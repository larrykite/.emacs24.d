;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This library modifies commands `narrow-to-region',
;;    `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' (`C-x n n', `C-x n d',
;;    and `C-x n p') so that the current buffer restriction
;;    (narrowing) is added to a list of restrictions for the current
;;    buffer, `wide-n-restrictions'.
;;
;;    You can then use `C-x n x' to cycle among previous buffer
;;    restrictions.  Repeating `x' repeats the action: `C-x n x x x x'
;;    etc.  Each time you hit `x' a different narrowing is made
;;    current.  This gives you an easy way to browse your past
;;    narrowings.
;;
;;    Invoking `C-x n x' with a prefix argument changes the behavior
;;    as follows:
;;
;;    * A plain prefix arg (`C-u') widens the buffer completely.
;; 
;;    * A zero numeric prefix arg (e.g `C-0') widens completely
;;      and resets (empties) the list of restrictions.
;;
;;    * A numeric prefix arg N takes you directly to the abs(N)th
;;      previous restriction.  That is, it widens abs(N) times.
;;      Positive and negative args work the same, except that a
;;      negative arg also pops entries off the ring: it removes the
;;      ring entries from the most recent back through the (-)Nth one.
;;
;;    Be default, `C-x n x' is bound to command `wide-n-repeat'.  If
;;    you use Emacs 21 then you will want to change this key binding
;;    to command `wide-n', which is a non-repeatable version.
;;    Repeatability is not available before Emacs 22.
;;
;;    Emacs markers are used to record restriction limits, so the same
;;    restriction is available even if you modify its context.  If for
;;    any reason `wide-n-restrictions' ever has any entries that use
;;    buffer positions (numbers) instead of markers, invoking `wide-n'
;;    corrects this by changing the positions to markers.
;;
;;    This means that you can serialize `wide-n-restrictions',
;;    converting all markers to positions, save the value
;;    persistently, and restore it later.  Library `bookmark+.el' does
;;    this in order to let you bookmark and restore a list of
;;    restrictions.
;;
;;    In normal use, only the interactive use of commands
;;    `narrow-to-region', `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' is
;;    affected by this library.  When these functions are called
;;    non-interactively there is normally no change to the value of
;;    variable `wide-n-restrictions'.  However, if for some reason you
;;    want to add entries to the restrictions ring when narrowing with
;;    some Emacs-Lisp code (i.e. non-interactively), you can do so by
;;    binding variable `wide-n-push-anyway-p' around the narrowing
;;    call.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `wide-n', `wide-n-repeat', 
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `wide-n-markerize', `wide-n-push', `wide-n-repeat-command'.
;;
;;  Internal variables defined here:
;;
;;    `wide-n-push-anyway-p', `wide-n-restrictions'.
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: This EMACS PRIMITIVE has been ADVISED HERE:
;;
;;    `narrow-to-region'.
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `lisp.el' and
;;              `page.el' have been REDEFINED here:
;;
;;    `narrow-to-defun', `narrow-to-page'.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2011/04/09 dadams
;;     narrow-to-region defadvice:
;;       Use ad-get-arg - don't refer to args by name (work around Emacs bug #8457).
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookies (for commands).
;; 2010/04/26 dadams
;;     Added: wide-n-push, wide-n-push-anyway-p.
;;     narrow-to-*: Call wide-n-push when interactive or wide-n-push-anyway-p.
;; 2010/04/24 dadams
;;     Added: wide-n-markerize.
;;     Use non-destructive operations (again, as initially).
;;       wide-n-restrictions: Use (all) cons as init value.
;;       wide-n, narrow-to-region: Don't initialize to (all).
;;       wide-n: Use append, not nconc.
;;       narrow-to-region: Use remove, not delete.
;;     wide-n: Use wide-n-markerize.
;; 2010/04/21 dadams
;;     Bind non-repeatable version, wide-n, in Emacs 21.
;; 2010/04/19 dadams
;;     wide-n, narrow-to-region, wide-n-restrictions:
;;       Use nil default val & use make-local-variable, so can use destructive ops.
;;     narrow-to-region: Use delete, not remove.
;;     Zero prefix arg now widens completely and empties ring.
;;     Negative prefix arg now pops the ring.
;;     Added: standard definitions of narrow-to-(defun|page).
;;     Use narrow-map if defined.
;; 2010/04/18 dadams
;;     Created.
